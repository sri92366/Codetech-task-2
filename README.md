**Overview of the project:**
As more organizations migrate their infrastructure to the cloud, the need for resilient and secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks becomes more important. AWS offers a powerful VPC service that allows users to create their own virtual network in the cloud.

However, setting up and managing a VPC can be difficult and time-consuming. That's where Terraform comes in as an open-source infrastructure as a code tool that can help automate creating and managing AWS resources.

In this article, we'll explore how to use Terraform to create a VPC on AWS, including the various components that make up a VPC and the steps required to implement them. By the end of this article, you'll know exactly how to use Terraform to build your own secure and scalable VPC network on AWS.
